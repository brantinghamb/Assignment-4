               <p> Haley Martin and I are getting married. We met after we both graduated from college. She went to Oklahoma Sate University.
                   I went to Kansas Sate University. We met through mutual friends. She went to high school with him and he was
                   my friend that I met while I was in college.

                   <div class="intro"> Haley and I dated for a few years from 2015-2018. I lived in Topeka and she lived in Lawerence. I would come visit each other
                   on the weekends and speak with eachother on the phone. We would do various things together: going to Kansas State and 
                   Okalhoma State football games, visiting cities like Chicago, Austin, Memphis. in 2017 Haley moved to Kansas City. She lived on 
                   the Missouri side of the city. It was a longer commute for the two of us. Since it was a longer commute, I decided to leave my 
                   job in Topeka and move to Kansas City and live with Haley.

                   Haley and I lived together for about a year and I decided to propose. Luckly she said, "Yes!" and for the past year we have been
                   planning out wedding. It has been a long and expensive processes. With that aside, we are very excited to final be married
                   together. We will have our ceremony and reception on Feburary 22nd at a venue called 2016 Main. It is downtown on Main St.
                   We are very excited to say our "I do's." then and begin our lives together!
